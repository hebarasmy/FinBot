deepseek,analytical-1,analytical,Global,How might rising interest rates affect tech stocks?,Financial insight regarding How might rising interest... in the Global market: This involves consideration of multiple economic indicators and market trends.,"Rising interest rates typically have a negative impact on tech stocks for several reasons. Higher rates increase the cost of borrowing, which can reduce profit margins for tech companies that rely on debt financing for growth. More importantly, rising rates affect the discount rate used in valuation models, which reduces the present value of future cash flows. Since tech companies often have earnings weighted toward the future, they can be particularly sensitive to these valuation adjustments. Additionally, higher rates can lead to reduced consumer spending on technology products and services.",0.8050408363342285,12,39,48.44474744608904,0.0
deepseek,analytical-2,analytical,Global,What is the relationship between oil prices and inflation?,Financial insight regarding What is the relationship ... in the Global market: This involves consideration of multiple economic indicators and market trends.,"Oil prices and inflation typically have a strong positive correlation. When oil prices rise, the cost of energy inputs increases across the economy, affecting transportation, manufacturing, and utility costs. These higher costs are often passed on to consumers, leading to broader price increases. Oil is also a component in many products, from plastics to chemicals, so price increases can ripple through supply chains. However, the relationship can vary based on factors like the oil-intensity of an economy, monetary policy responses, and whether price changes are driven by supply or demand factors.",0.8050589561462402,14,39,48.44365707909172,0.0

deepseek,explanatory-1,explanatory,Global,Explain how inflation impacts bond yields.,Financial insight regarding Explain how inflation imp... in the Global market: This involves consideration of multiple economic indicators and market trends.,"Inflation impacts bond yields through several mechanisms. First, higher inflation erodes the purchasing power of future interest payments and principal repayments, making existing bonds less attractive and causing their prices to fall and yields to rise. Second, central banks typically respond to higher inflation by raising policy rates, which pushes up yields across the bond market. Third, investors demand an 'inflation premium' on longer-term bonds when they expect higher future inflation, further increasing yields. The relationship between inflation and real yields (nominal yields minus inflation) is particularly important for investors, as positive real yields are necessary to preserve purchasing power over time.",0.8023579120635986,10,39,48.606736985611825,0.16666666666666666

Many Asian markets have stronger government influence and intervention. Market maturity varies significantly across Asia, with Japan being highly developed while frontier markets like Vietnam are still evolving.
