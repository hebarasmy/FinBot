  "query": "Explain how inflation impacts bond yields.",
  "response": "Inflation significantly impacts bond yields through several interconnected mechanisms:\n\n1. **Erosion of Purchasing Power**: As inflation rises, the purchasing power of the future interest payments and principal repayments from existing bonds diminishes. Investors holding bonds with fixed interest rates find their returns less attractive because the real value of those payments decreases in an inflationary environment. This leads to a decline in bond prices, as investors demand higher yields to compensate for the loss of purchasing power, resulting in an increase in nominal bond yields.\n\n2. **Central Bank Policy Responses**: In response to rising inflation, central banks typically increase policy interest rates to help control inflationary pressures. Higher policy rates lead to increased yields across the entire bond market. As the central bank raises rates, newly issued bonds feature higher yields, making existing bonds with lower yields less appealing, which can further push down their prices and raise yields.\n\n3. **Demand for Inflation Premium**: Investors often require an 'inflation premium' on longer-term bonds in anticipation of rising inflation. This premium is the additional yield above the risk-free rate that investors demand to compensate for the uncertainty about future inflation. If inflation expectations increase, yields on longer-term bonds will rise as investors seek compensation through higher returns.\n\n4. **Real Yields**: The relationship between inflation and real yields (nominal yields minus inflation) is crucial for bond investors. Positive real yields are necessary to preserve purchasing power over time. If inflation outpaces nominal yields, the real yield becomes negative, disincentivizing investment in bonds. Investors are more likely to seek alternative investments that offer better returns when real yields are low or negative.\n\nOverall, higher inflation typically results in increased bond yields as investors adjust to the changing economic environment, seek compensation for diminished purchasing power, and respond to central bank monetary policy.",
  "reference": "Inflation impacts bond yields through several mechanisms. First, higher inflation erodes the purchasing power of future interest payments and principal repayments, making existing bonds less attractive and causing their prices to fall and yields to rise. Second, central banks typically respond to higher inflation by raising policy rates, which pushes up yields across the bond market. Third, investors demand an 'inflation premium' on longer-term bonds when they expect higher future inflation, further increasing yields. The relationship between inflation and real yields (nominal yields minus inflation) is particularly important for investors, as positive real yields are necessary to preserve purchasing power over time.",
