        "reference_answer": "The S&P 500 returned approximately 24.2% in 2023, marking a strong year of recovery after the declines seen in 2022. This performance was driven largely by technology stocks and the enthusiasm around artificial intelligence developments.",

        "expected_keywords": ["interest rates", "tech stocks", "impact", "valuation", "growth", "discount"],
        "reference_answer": "Rising interest rates typically have a negative impact on tech stocks for several reasons. Higher rates increase the cost of borrowing, which can reduce profit margins for tech companies that rely on debt financing for growth. More importantly, rising rates affect the discount rate used in valuation models, which reduces the present value of future cash flows. Since tech companies often have earnings weighted toward the future, they can be particularly sensitive to these valuation adjustments. Additionally, higher rates can lead to reduced consumer spending on technology products and services.",

        "expected_keywords": ["oil prices", "inflation", "correlation", "energy costs", "consumer prices", "transportation"],
        "reference_answer": "Oil prices and inflation typically have a strong positive correlation. When oil prices rise, the cost of energy inputs increases across the economy, affecting transportation, manufacturing, and utility costs. These higher costs are often passed on to consumers, leading to broader price increases. Oil is also a component in many products, from plastics to chemicals, so price increases can ripple through supply chains. However, the relationship can vary based on factors like the oil-intensity of an economy, monetary policy responses, and whether price changes are driven by supply or demand factors.",

        "reference_answer": "During recessions, defensive sectors typically outperform the broader market. These include utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, as they provide essential products and services that consumers need regardless of economic conditions. Utilities offer necessary services like electricity and water, consumer staples companies provide everyday items like food and household products, and healthcare remains essential regardless of economic cycles. Additionally, certain subsectors of telecommunications and discount retailers may perform well as consumers become more price-conscious. However, each recession has unique characteristics, and performance can vary based on the specific causes and severity of the economic downturn.",

        "expected_keywords": ["inflation", "bond yields", "interest rates", "purchasing power", "central bank", "monetary policy"],
        "reference_answer": "Inflation impacts bond yields through several mechanisms. First, higher inflation erodes the purchasing power of future interest payments and principal repayments, making existing bonds less attractive and causing their prices to fall and yields to rise. Second, central banks typically respond to higher inflation by raising policy rates, which pushes up yields across the bond market. Third, investors demand an 'inflation premium' on longer-term bonds when they expect higher future inflation, further increasing yields. The relationship between inflation and real yields (nominal yields minus inflation) is particularly important for investors, as positive real yields are necessary to preserve purchasing power over time.",

        "reference_answer": "Asian stock markets differ from Western markets in several key aspects. They typically have higher retail investor participation compared to the institutional dominance in Western markets, which can lead to greater volatility. Many Asian markets have stronger government influence and intervention. Market maturity varies significantly across Asia, with Japan being highly developed while frontier markets like Vietnam are still evolving. Corporate governance standards and transparency requirements often differ, though they're increasingly converging with global standards. Trading hours and holiday schedules reflect regional cultural differences. Additionally, sector composition varies, with many Asian indices having higher weightings in manufacturing, technology hardware, and emerging industries compared to Western indices' greater representation of services, healthcare, and established technology.",
