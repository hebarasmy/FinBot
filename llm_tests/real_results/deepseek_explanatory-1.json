  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to explain how inflation impacts bond yields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that inflation and bond yields are related, but I'm not exactly sure how. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you buy a bond, you're essentially loaning money to a borrower, like a government or a corporation. In return, they pay you interest over time, and eventually return the principal. The interest rate, or the yield, is what you earn on that investment.\n\nNow, inflation is the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising. So, if inflation goes up, things cost more. But how does that affect the bond yields? I think it's because inflation erodes the purchasing power of the money you get back. So, if you have a bond that pays 5% interest, but inflation is 3%, your real return is only 2%. That makes sense.\n\nSo, if inflation is expected to rise, people might demand higher yields when buying new bonds. Why? Because they want to make sure their returns aren't eaten away by inflation. It's like they need a higher nominal return to maintain the same purchasing power. So, when inflation goes up, bond yields go up too. That seems to make sense.\n\nBut wait, what happens to existing bonds when inflation increases? If I already own a bond with a lower yield, say 4%, and inflation goes up, the value of that bond would go down, right? Because new bonds are being issued with higher yields, making my older bond less attractive. So, the price of existing bonds falls when inflation rises, which in turn increases their yields because the yield is the interest payment divided by the lower price.\n\nI also remember something about the Federal Reserve or central banks adjusting interest rates. When inflation is high, they might raise interest rates to control it. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can slow down spending and investment, thus curbing inflation. So, when the Fed raises rates, new bonds issued will have higher yields, and existing bonds might lose value because their fixed yields are less competitive.\n\nThere's also something about inflation expectations. If people think inflation will be higher in the future, they might buy bonds with longer maturities to lock in higher yields now. Or maybe they avoid long-term bonds because they expect inflation to rise, so they prefer shorter terms where they can adjust more",
  "reference": "Inflation impacts bond yields through several mechanisms. First, higher inflation erodes the purchasing power of future interest payments and principal repayments, making existing bonds less attractive and causing their prices to fall and yields to rise. Second, central banks typically respond to higher inflation by raising policy rates, which pushes up yields across the bond market. Third, investors demand an 'inflation premium' on longer-term bonds when they expect higher future inflation, further increasing yields. The relationship between inflation and real yields (nominal yields minus inflation) is particularly important for investors, as positive real yields are necessary to preserve purchasing power over time.",
